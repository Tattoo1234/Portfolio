# Portfolio
## Description
This portfolio was created to showcase projects I have completed to demstrate what my coding abilities are, and what styles and asthetics I have to offer.  The portfolio can be provided to prospective employers who view my projects in their process of determining suitability for hire.  This portfolio puts all my projects in one location so I can easily demonstrate my quality as a coder.  In this project I learned how to position images and sections on a webpage, how to link images to specific URL's, and how to build a site from scratch.  Other concepts learned in bootcamp thus far were also applied.
